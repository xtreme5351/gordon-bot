# gordonBot
Its main purpose is to set timers and reminders for certain callable roles in a specific discord server. Everything thing on the bot is interacted through the "g." command.
All the ways to call the functions will be described in the notes above the functions themselves. If you are going to use this bot, please the notes above the commands first and make sure to install the packages on the device, before running. 

To create a bot application, go to this link: https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications

Steps to get discord bot token:
Click on your application > "Bot" > "Click to reveal token" > "Copy"

This is for mainly personal use but idc who else uses it, I'll update it whenever.

Invite.txt is just my bot's invite code that is retrieved from discord apps. Dont use that, its not valid anyway

RoleIds.txt was just a test to output different role IDs to an external file.

Ty :D
