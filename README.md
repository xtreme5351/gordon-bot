# gordonBot
Its main purpose is to set timers and reminders for certain callable roles in a specific discord server. Everything thing on the bot is interacted through the "g." command.
All the ways to call the functions will be described in the notes above the functions themselves. If you are going to use this bot, please the notes above the commands first and make sure to install the packages on the device, before running.

Note
===

Invite.txt is just my bot's invite code that is retrieved from discord apps. Dont use that, its not valid anyway
RoleIds.txt was just a test to output different role IDs to an external file.

This is for mainly personal use but idc who else uses it, I'll update it whenever.
